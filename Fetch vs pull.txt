git fetch it will just fetch all the changes in the remote repository (Github) and move the origin/master pointer to HEAD. 

git pull, it will do basically fetch (as explained previously) and merge any new changes to your master branch and move the pointer to HEAD.
So, git pull=git fetch + merge.

command “git fetch <remote>” followed by “git merge <remote>”.

 command “git pull <remote>”
